InstallKeyCertificate
=====================

uses Win32 API to install Windows 7 OEM SLP product key and certificate

I had to reverse engineer the API, I got a few good hints from a COM object
that didn't have debugging symbols removed. this project is usefull to further
investigate how Windows 7 activation works and could provide hints on how 
Windows 10 activation works.
